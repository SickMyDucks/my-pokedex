## Searching a Pokemon
This Pokedex does only contain first generation pokemons, with names in *english*. It is case insensitive, 
so if you try `magikarp` or `Magikarp` it is the same. You can also search with the pokemon's number, without the `0`: 
You can look for Pikachu by entering `25` and not `025`.

**Note:** Some pokemons can't be called like this, because of their special characters or attributes in their name such
as Farfetch'd, Nidoran F & M, Mr.Mime...

## Navigation

It is possible to go to the previous thanks to the arrow on the joystick. You can go from 1 to 151.

The two buttons under the screen allows the user to ***cancel a search***, or to search . Canceling on a pokemon's card
won't hide it. It will only hide the search form.
